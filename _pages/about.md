Greetings! I am Yasi Zhang, currently a PhD student in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) and Prof. [Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Data Science from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).
