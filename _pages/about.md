ðŸŒˆ Greetings! I am Yasi Zhang (She/They), currently a PhD student in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I'm fortunate to be co-advised by two of the best advisors in the world, Prof. [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/) and Prof. [Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). In summer 2024, I conducted a research internship at [Amazon AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/). I will be joining [Google Research](https://research.google/) for a student researcher internship in Spring 2025.

My research goal is to learn representations that can help generation, reasoning, planning and optimization. My primary focus lies in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, particularly in learning from/recovering corrupted data,  and scientific discovery. My recent research interests include:

- **Generative AI**: Learning to generate realistic and diverse samples from complex data distributions.

- **Computer Vision**: Learning representations for images and videos, and understanding the underlying semantics.

- **Multimodality**: Learning from multiple modalities, such as text, image, and audio.
