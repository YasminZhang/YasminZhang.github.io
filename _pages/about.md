ðŸŒˆ Greetings! I am Yasi Zhang (She/They), currently a PhD student in the Department of [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/). I'm super fortunate to be co-advised by two of the best advisors in the world, Prof. [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/research.html) and Prof. [Oscar Leong](https://www.oscarleong.com/). Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/). I conducted an Applied Scientist internship at [Amazon AWS AI Labs](https://aws.amazon.com/) in Summer 2024 and a Student Researcher internship at [Google Research](https://research.google/) in Spring&Summer 2025.

The current generative AI revolution is a result of large-scale datasets, huge computing power, and scalable neural networks.
 My research goal is to relax the assumptions. a harder version of unsupervised learning, e.g. learning clean distributions from corrupted data, improve the reasoning ability of current generative models by exploring attention mechanism and Chain-of-Thought.  
My research goal is to learn generative models representations that can help generation, reasoning, planning and optimization. My primary focus lies in machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, particularly in learning from/recovering corrupted data,  and scientific discovery. My recent research interests include:

- **Generative AI**: Learning to generate realistic and diverse samples from complex data distributions.

- **Computer Vision**: Learning representations for images and videos, and understanding the underlying semantics.

- **Multimodality**: Learning from multiple modalities, such as text, image, and audio.
